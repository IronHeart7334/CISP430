; Write a console32 Assembly Language program to calculate this expression using a multiplication:
;   2 ( − a + b − 1 ) + 6
;   where
;       a is the number of semester units needed for the CRC Computer Science certificate
;       b is the population of Galt, CA as of the 2010 U.S. census
;   Rearrange the formula so you can use unsigned integers for the program.
;   Justify the sizes you choose for this problem.
;   You'll need to start small for the multiplication and then match the sizes after the multiplication.
;   Clearly describe in a Register Dictionary what every register holds as your program executes.
